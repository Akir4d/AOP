# Angular On PHP (AOP)

I'm now working on developing a solution backend and frontend that is based on PHP and Angular. I decided to use Codeigniter as the PHP framework backend (and potentially frontend at you choice). Codeigniter was the best choice for me because to its extensive documentation, its diminutive size, and the fact that it offers an optional robust business logic. The framework makes use of a script that I produced that assists even inexperienced programmers in adding Modules and Controllers. It is also built in two versions: one for HTTP servers that support .htaccess (like apache) and one for all other servers with the "public" folder that has to be made public. Also includes an update manager.... everyone is welcome to contribute!

This is a comprehensive modular template for developing an application using Angular and CodeIgniter 4.2.
This template may be run on a standard LAMP (PHP 7.4 or highter) server without any special configuration; simply build and copy to the apache folder and enjoy.

# Pre-Requisites Setup Windows
- install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) 
- install [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.html) with php 7.4 highter on default folder (c:\xampp) 
- open xampp controls on apache config click to edit php.ini
- uncomment (remove ";") extension=intl and extension=gd (It is not necessary to run apache)

# Build Setup Common
- unpack AOP and open a terminal inside the folder just opened
- Do `node aop serve` and you'll can access debug angular to http://localhost:4200 and whole framework debug on http://localhost:8085

# All in one!
Aop comes with the tool aop, that you can start with: 
```
node aop command ...args
```
eg: 
```
node aop serve
```

Trick: do `node aop install` to call aop without node

eg: 
```
aop serve
```


to use the command as eg: aop build

|Command| Description |
|-------|--------------------|
|serve|This begins the development server for Angular and Codeigniter at http://localhost:4200 and http://localhost:8085. You might alternatively use a separate module to serve as a comment, for instance: aop emergency serve or aop serve emergency | 
|spark|This launches the Codeigniter spark utility|
|composer|This launches the Composer PHP tool.|
|ng   | This invokes the Angular ng utility, and you may also begin using it with a different module, such as aop ng emergency... or aop emergency ng ... for example.|
|npm  | This invokes the Angular npm utility, and you may alternatively start using it with a different module, such as aop npm emergency... or aop emergency npm... for example.|
|npx  | This invokes the Angular npx utility, and you may also start using it with a different module, such as aop npx emergency... or aop emergency npx... for example.|
|ma  | This creates an Angular module which can then be loaded into controller using the method aopRender.|
|mc  | This will convert an existing Angular project inside of asrc to a module, which can then be loaded into controller using the method aopRender.|
|build| This generates a full plug-and-play package in the build folder; but, if you choose, you may generate only one module instead of all of them. For instance: aop build emergency|
|build:others|This generates a complete plug-and-play package on the build folder for all servers that do not support ".htaccess." For reasons of safety, the "public" subfolder is the only one that must be shared; alternatively, you can build just one module rather than all of them. Here is an example of what this might look like: aop build emergency|
|copy|This will copy your build to a remote ftp server or a folder using the following syntax: ftp: /user:pass@host[:path]|
|install|This will install aop as a command inside the system.|


Options:
|   Option   | Alternative | Description         |
| :---------  | :-------------- | :--------------------- |
|...........................|..............................|.............................................................................................|
| *-c path*   | *--copy=path* |Following the completion of the build, this command will transfer the build to a specified folder or an external FTP server using the syntax ftp:/user:pass@host[ :path].|
| *-u username* | *--username=user* |ftp username.|
| *-p password* | *--password=pass* |ftp password.|
| *-fp port*  | *--ftp-port=port* |change the default ftp port.|

 
 

# Human Develop Requirements ðŸ˜‰
- basic Angular skills 
- basic PHP knowledge

# Build Requirements
- PHP 7.4 or highter
- node 18 or highter

# Destination Server Requirements
- Apache 2 or Nginx (it could works to others with php support on)
- PHP 7.4 or highter with intl and gd support

# Aop files

| File | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| aopm/versions | required in order to make codeigniter auto-update works |
| aopm/versions/composer.php | a Small composer init file |
| aopm/header.php | just an header for update.php |
| aopm/update.php | This script executes "Composer Update" straight from the browser during the initial http request to ensure that all framework dependencies and server prerequisites are met. It auto-disables itself after first execution, to re-enable it delete aopm/versions/*.txt|
| aop | Scripting tool that facilitates development using both framework|

To edit code, I recommend using [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
